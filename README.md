# Landing page for imaginary app made with Bootstrap v5.2

Third Web Development Bootcamp project made almost by given example for learning the basics of Bootstrap. 
Besides the course information, I had to learn some things by myself the hard way. 
I think it looks good, but with famous "Bootstrap aftertaste".
